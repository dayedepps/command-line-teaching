## Catalogue of resources providing learner with basic knowledge of command line 

Researchers in the life sciences and medical sciences increasingly rely on applications that lack a graphical interface and require typing commands through a terminal rather than using a mouse and graphical interface (GUI). Scientists who are not trained in computer science face an enormous challenge in analyzing high-throughput data. 

We have prepared online catalogue of resources and published papers providing first-time learners with basic knowledge of command line.
The catalogue was prepared for our study "Addressing the digital divide in contemporary biology: Lessons from teaching UNIX". Preprint is available here : [http://biorxiv.org/content/early/2017/04/07/122424](http://biorxiv.org/content/early/2017/04/07/122424)

## Catalogue of resources providing learner with basic knowledge of command line 

Researchers in the life sciences and medical sciences increasingly rely on applications that lack a graphical interface and require typing commands through a terminal rather than using a mouse and graphical interface (GUI). Scientists who are not trained in computer science face an enormous challenge in analyzing high-throughput data. 

We have prepared online catalogue of resources and published papers providing learner with basic knowledge of command line.
The catalogue was prepared for our study "Addressing the digital divide in contemporary biology: Lessons from teaching UNIX". Preprint is available here : http://biorxiv.org/content/early/2017/04/07/122424
